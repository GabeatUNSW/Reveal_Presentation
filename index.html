					<p style="font-size:20px">The deisgn concept of Control and Freedom was inspired from the movie Akira. The movie is set in a post apocalyptic city where the government controls everything including the people and the people try to get out of the control through seeking freedom. </p>

					<img src="roof.jpg" style="width:100%">
					<p style="font-size:20px">The image shown on the right is from the very last scene of the movie where one of the main character turns into a monster. I depicted the monster's undefined and random shape into how the roof is designed. </p>

The middle part is the Theater and the two part on the side are the residence. The left side is the living room and kitchen space with big open space where the owner could invite friends to come over.
